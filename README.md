# Github-Puller-Proxy

Github Puller Proxy is the companion app to Hernoku which hosts the backend code and manages all the live projects on the site.

GPP also listens for webhooks made when a github branch is updated. When this occurs, it redownloads the projects and runs the updated code.

## Companion App

[Hernoku](https://github.com/alexjharrison/hernoku) is the companion app to github puller proxy and is used to manage the live projects being served on the Raspberry Pi.
